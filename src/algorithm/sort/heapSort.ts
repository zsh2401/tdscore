/**
 * 
 * Heap Sort
 * 
 * In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. 
 * Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort, 
 * heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it 
 * iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element 
 * from it and inserting it into the sorted region. Unlike selection sort, 
 * heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted region; 
 * rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a heap data structure 
 * to more quickly find the largest element in each step.
 *
 * Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, 
 * it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime. 
 * Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort.
 *
 * Heapsort was invented by J. W. J. Williams in 1964. This was 
 * also the birth of the heap, presented already by Williams as a 
 * useful data structure in its own right. In the same year, 
 * R. W. Floyd published an improved version that could sort an array in-place, 
 * continuing his earlier research into the treesort algorithm.
