/**
* 
* Shell Sort
* 
* Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, 
* is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as either a generalization of 
* sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort).
* The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each 
* other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. 
* By starting with far apart elements, it can move some out-of-place elements 
* into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange. Donald Shell 
* published the first version of this sort in 1959. The running time of 
* Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For many practical 
* variants, determining their time complexity remains an open problem.
* 
* @SortType Insertion Sort
* @Stability Unstable
* @TimeComplexity O(n ^ 1.5)
* @SpaceComplexity O(1)
* 
* @param a The target array which is being sorted.
* @param comparer The comparer used to compare elements.
